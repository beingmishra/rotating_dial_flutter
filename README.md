# **Rotating Dial**

This was my attempt to recreate https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shubham0812_swiftui-iosdevelopment-iosdev-activity-7224994556247691264-Pg1d?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop.

Creating this animation was a fun challenge. This version maintains the structure and tone of the original post, but focuses on Flutter and gives credit to the inspiration from the SwiftUI project.
